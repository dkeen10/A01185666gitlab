The .md extension stands for markdown, and a README.md typically provides the html summary at the bottom of the github page.  Markdown takes plain text, performs any syntax changes on it, then converts it to HTML so it can be shown on the page.

Markdown is a markup language, which means that it has some syntax to change the plaintext, like:

===== underneath text to make a heading
=======================================

- dashes "-" infront of text to make list items.

*asterisks around text to make it italicized*

and more.

Github chose to use .md because it is lightweight and adds extra functionality to basic plain text.  However, github did find that the base markdown language was missing some elements, so they added the github flavored markdown.
