The .md extension stands for markdown, and a README.md typically provides the html summary at the bottom of the github page.

Markdown is a markup language, which means that it has some syntax to change the plaintext, like:
===== underneath text to make a heading
=======================================
*around text to make is italicized"
- -to make list items
and more.
