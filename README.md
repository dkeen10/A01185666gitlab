The .md extension stands for markdown, and a README.md typically provides the html summary at the bottom of the github page.

Markdown is a markup language, which means that it has some syntax to change the plaintext, like:

"=====" underneath text to make a heading
=======================================

* asterisks "*" around text to make it italicized"

- dashes "-" infront of text to make list items

and more.
